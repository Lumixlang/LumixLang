## Overview

Lumix is a programming language designed for programming low level and high level all using a high level syntax. This README provides instructions on how to run Lumix files using the command-line interface (CLI).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Lumix Compiler (Comes with the installation)

### Installation

1. Install Lumix from the [original website](https://lumixlang.github.io/). Make sure it's the right for your platform.
2. The other steps are provided on the website.

## Running Lumix Files

To run a Lumix file, you can use the Lumix CLI. Currently, you can run a Lumix file using the provided batch file:

```bash
./src/cli/lumix.bat ./index.lum
```

Explanation: The command above runs the Lumix batch file, passing the Lumix file `index.lum` as an argument.

### Future CLI Usage

Once Lumix is fully equipped with a CLI, you'll be able to use a simpler command:

```bash
lum ./index.lum
```
or
```bash
lumix ./index.lum
```

This assumes that Lumix has been added to your system's PATH during installation.
